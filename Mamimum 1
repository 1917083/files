# Python program to find the
# maximum of two numbers
 
 
def maximum(a, b):
     
    if a >= b:
        return a
    else:
        return b
     
# Driver code
a = 2
b = 4
print(maximum(a, b))
Output
4
Method #2: Using max() function
This function is used to find the maximum of the values passed as its arguments.

Example: 

Python3
# Python program to find the
# maximum of two numbers
 
 
a = 2
b = 4
 
maximum = max(a, b)
print(maximum)
Output
4

This operator is also known as conditional expression are operators that evaluate something based on a condition being true or false. It simply allows testing a condition in a single line

Example:

Python3
# Python program to find the
# maximum of two numbers
     
# Driver code
a = 2
b = 4
 
# Use of ternary oper
print(a if a >= b else b)

Output
4
